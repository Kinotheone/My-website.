        <h2>Story Connections: Themes Across Media</h2>
        
        <h3>Universal Patterns in Hero Stories</h3>
        <p>Across all these narratives, certain patterns emerge that reflect fundamental truths about human growth and character development. The protagonists don't start as the strongest or smartest - they become extraordinary through consistent effort, moral choices, and staying true to their values even when it's difficult.</p>

        <div class="practice-list">
            <h3>The Training Arc Philosophy</h3>
            <p>From Dragon Ball's intense physical training to One Punch Man's simple daily routine, these stories emphasize that growth comes through consistent practice. The characters don't just get stronger - they develop discipline, patience, and resilience that serves them in all aspects of life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-list">
            <h3>The Protection Principle</h3>
            <p>Whether it's protecting Earth from alien invaders or protecting a family's peaceful life, these heroes are defined not by their power but by what they choose to protect. This gives their strength purpose and meaning beyond personal achievement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-list">
            <h3>The Growth Mindset Message</h3>
            <p>Every character faces moments of failure and setback. What distinguishes them is their response - they view challenges as opportunities to become better rather than proof of their limitations. This mirrors real psychological research on growth mindset and resilience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="practice-list">
            <h3>The Humility Factor</h3>
            <p>Paradoxically, the most powerful characters often display the greatest humility. They don't seek glory or recognition but focus on doing what's right. This teaches that true strength comes with responsibility and grace.</p>
